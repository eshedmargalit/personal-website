Hi, I'm Eshed! This blog is a place for my thoughts on neuroscience, machine learning, and science more broadly.

I currently work as an ML researcher at [Noetik](https://www.noetik.ai/), which is my first foray into cancer immunology.

Before that, I worked as the founding engineer/researcher at a stealth startup inventing new approaches to self-supervised learning of world models.

Before that, I did my PhD in Neuroscience at Stanford, where I worked with Dan Yamins ([lab website](https://neuroailab.stanford.edu/research.html)) and Kalanit Grill-Spector ([lab website](http://vpnl.stanford.edu/#/)) on self-supervised neural network models of visual cortex.
You can read [the paper that came out of that](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627324002794?dgcid=author) or, if you're in the mood to read 100+ pages instead, my [dissertation](https://purl.stanford.edu/pn433ry1536).

Before that, I studied computational neuroscience and computer science at USC.
While there, I worked with Prof. Irving Biederman on the neural correlates of shape and face recognition.

Before that, I grew up in the Bay Area where I became fond of running and redwoods.
